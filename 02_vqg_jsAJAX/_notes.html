<!--*****************************************************************************************************************
*	WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT?
*
*	- JavaScript is a programming language that you can use to add interactivity to your Web pages.
*	- JavaScript lets you create an active user interface, giving the users feedback as they navigate your pages.
*	- You can use JavaScript to make sure that your users enter valid information in forms, which can save your business time and money.
*	- With JavaScript you have the ability create customized Web pages, depending on actions that the user takes.
* 	- JavaScript controls the browser, so you can open up new windows, display alert boxes, and put custom messages 
*	  in the status bar of the browser window.
*	- You can also use JavaScript to deal with forms, set cookies, build HTML pages on the fly, and create Web-based applications.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	WHAT IS AJAX?
*
*	- Ajax is shorthand for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
*	- Ajax is the combination of these technologies:
*		- XHTML
*		- CSS
*		- The DOM (Document Object Model) accessed using JavaScript
*		- XML, the format of the data being transferred between the server and the client
*		- XMLHttpRequest to retrieve data from the server
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	THE SNAP-TOGETHER LANGUAGE
*
*	- JavaScript is an object-oriented language.
*
*		OBJECT: 
*			- Some kind of a thing, (i.e. windows and forms, and the elements of the form, such as buttons and check boxes).
*			- Give objects their own unique names.
*
*		PROPERTIES: 
*			- A window has a title, and a form can have a check box.
*			- Changing a property of an object modifies that object, and the same property name can be a part of completely different objects.
*			- (i.e. You have a property called empty. Use empty wherever it applies, the cat's tummy is empty and the cat's bowl is empty.)
*
*		METHODS:
*			- The things that objects can do.
*			- (i.e. Cats purr, computers crash, and bicycles roll.)
*			- JavaScript objects also have methods: buttons click(), windows open(), and text can be selected(). 
*			  The parentheses signal that we're referring to a method, rather than a property.
*	
*			TIP: 	
* 				- Think of objects and properties as nouns. They are things.
* 				- Think of methods as verbs. They are actions that those things can do, or have done to them.
*
*	- DOT SYNTAX: 
*		- Put objects, properties, and methods together to get a better description of an object, or to describe a process.
*		- These pieces are separated by periods, dot syntax.
*
*			EXAMPLES OF OBJECTS & PROPERTIES:
*					bicycle.wheels
*					cat.paws.front.left
*					computer.drive.dvd
*					document.images.name
*					window.status
*
*			EXAMPLES OF OBJECTS & METHODS:
*					cat.purr()
*					document.write()
*					forms.elements.radio.click()
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	INTRODUCING THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
*
*	- Document Object Model (DOM): the representation of the objects within the document
*		- The objects that make up the document are representated in a tree structure.
*		- JavaScript considers each of the items in the document tree to be objects, and you can use JavaScript to manipulate those objects.
*		- Each of the objects on the tree is also called a node of the tree. 
*		- Use JavaScript to modify any aspect of the tree, including addidng, accessing, changing, and deleting nodes on the tree.
*		- Each object on the tree is a node.
*		- If the node contains an HTML tag, it's referred to as an element node. Otherwise it is a text node.
*		- Element nodes can contain text nodes.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	HANDLING EVENTS
*
*	- EVENTS are actions that the user performs while visiting your page. 
*	  Submitting a form and moving a mouse over an image are two examples of events.
*
*	- JavaScript deals with events using commands called event handlers. 
*	  An action by the user on the page truggers an event handler in your script.
*
*		12 most commont JavaScript Event Handlers
*			1 - onabort				The user aborted loading the page
*			2 - oblur				The user left the object
*			3 - onchange			The user changed the object
*			4 - onclick				The user clicked an object
*			5 - onerror				The script encountered an error
*			6 - onfocus				The user made an object active
*			7 - onload				The object finished loading
*			8 - onmouseover			The cursor moved over an object
*			9 - onmouseout			The cursor moved off an object
*			10 - onselect			The user selected the contents of an object
*			11 - onsubmit			The user submitted a form
*			12 - onunload			The user left the page
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	VALUES AND VARIABLES
*
*	+ CODECADEMY.COM: 			Any variable in JavaScript is an object or a primitive.
*										"Hello World" is a string primitive.
*										5 is a number primitive.
*										The other primitive types are boolean, null, undefined.
*
*										Anything else including functions is an object.
*
* 	+ CODECADEMY.COM:			In JavaScript there are 6 values that evaluate to false:	
*										false
*										null
*										undefined
*										0
*										""
*										NaN
*	
*	- VALUE: in JavaScript it is a piece of information
*
*		Value Types
*			- Number			Any numeric value						3.141592654
*			- String			Characters inside quote marks			"Hello, world!"
*			- Boolean			True or False							true
*			- Null				Empty and meaningless
*			- Object			Any value associated with the object
*			- Function			Value returned by a function
*
*	- VARIABLES: contain values
*		
*		EX: Variable myName is assigned the string "Dori" 
*			Another way to write this is myName = "Dori"
*			The equals ign can be read as "is set to"
*			In other words, the variable myName now contains the value "Dori"
*
*	- OPERATORS: the symbols used to work with variables. 
*
*	+ CODECADEMY.COM:			Bang Operator (!) is used to change a truth value to a false and vice versa.
*										!true is false
*										!null is true
*
*		Operators
*			x + y (Numeric)			Adds x and y together
*			x + y (String)			Concatenates x and y together
*			x - y					Subtracts y from x
*			x * y					Multiplies x and y together
*			x / y 					Divides x by y
*			x % y					Modulous of x and y (i.e., the remainder when x is divided by y)
*			x++. ++x				Adds one to x (same as x = x + 1)
*			x--, --x				Subracts one from x (same as x = x - 1)
*			-x						Reverses the sign of x		
*
*			TIP: 	x++, increments x after the assignment is complete
*							if x is 5
*							y=x++ results in y set to 5 and x set to 6
*
*					++x, increments x before the assignment is complete
*							if x is 5
*							y=++x results in both x and y set to 6
*
*					If you mix numeric and string values when adding two values together, the result is a string. 
*							cat + 5 results in cat5
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	ASSIGNMENTS AND COMPARISIONS
*	
*	- ASSIGNMENT: put value into a variable, using an assignment operator to do the job.
*		
*		EX: Use the equals operator to make an assignment, such as hisName = "Tom"
*
*		Assignments
*			x = y			Sets x to the value of y
*			x += y			Same as x = x + y
*			x-= y			Same as x = x - y
*			x *= y			Same as x = x * y
*			x /= y			Same as x = x / y
*			x %= y			Same as x = x % y
*
*	- COMPARISIONS: compare the value of one variable with another, or the value of a variable 
*					against a literal value (i.e. value typed into the expression)
*		
*		EX: Compare the value of the day of the week to "Tuesday", and you can do this by checking if todaysDate == "Tuesday"
*	
*			TIP:	If you are comparing strings, be aware that "a" is greater than "A" and that "abacadabra" is less than "be".
*
*		Comparisions
*			x == y			Returns true if x and y are equal
*			x != y			Returns true if x and y are not equal
*			x > y			Returns true if x is greater than y
*			x > = y			Returns true if x is greater than or equal to y
*			x < y			Returns true if x is less than y
*			x <= y			Returns true if x is less than or equal to y
*			x && y			Returns true if both x and y are true
*			x || y			Returns true if either x or y is true
*			!x				Returns true if x is false
*
*	+ CODECADEMY.COM:			In JavaScript, == coerces values, which can lead to unexpected results. Remember to use === and !==
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	WRITING JAVASCRIPT-FRIENDLY HTML
*
*	- Because you'll be using JavaScript to manipulate the objects within a document, you want to write your HTML in 
*	  a way that can be easily used by your scripts.
*
*	- Your JavaScript should be an external document, one that contains only JavaScript code.
*
*	- Your site will contain three types of text files:
*			1 - XHTML: 			contains the content and structure of the page
*			2 - CSS: 			controls the appearance and presentation of the page
*			3 - JavaScript: 	controls the behavior of the page
*
*	- DIVS and SPANS: used to break up content into semantic chunks (chunks with simiar meaning)
*	
*		Things inside a single table cell or paragraph may or may not have anything in common, but the content within each 
*		div and span should.
*
*			Div: block-level element, there's a physical break between it and the lemenst above and below it.
*			Span: isn't block-level, it's inline. You can apply a single phrase within a sentence.
*
*		Add these two tags to your toolkit of solutions, and you'll be surprised how often you use them.
*
*	- CLASSES and IDS: use these attributes when you want to change their presentation or behavior.
*		
*		- CSS uses these attributes as part of rules to define the appearance of a page.
*		- JavaScript uses these attributes in code that affects the behavior of elements on the page.
*			
*		Once we've assigned classes and ids to our divs and spans we can modify those elements behavior with JavaScript.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	WHAT TOOLS TO USE?
*
*	- Text Editor
*		PC: Notepad
*		MAC: TextEdit
*		UNIX: Emacs
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	WHERE TO PUT YOUR SCRIPTS
*	
*	- Scripts can be put in one of two places on an HTML page:
*		1 - between the head tags
*		2 - between the body tags
*
*	- Opening script tag tells the browser to expect JavScript instead of HTML.
*	- The attribute, type="text/javascript" tells the browser that the script is plain text, organized as JavaScript.
*			<script type="text/javascript">
*			</script>
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	ABOUT FUNCTIONS
*
*	- A function is a set of JavaScript statements that performs a task. 
*	- Every function must be given a name and can be invoked, or called, by other parts of the script.
*	- Functions can be called as many times as needed during the running of a script.
*		
*		EX: You've got some information that a user typed into a form, and you've saved it using JavaScript.
*			If you need to use that information again and again, you could repeat the same code over and over
*			in your script. But it's better to write that code once as a function and then call the function
*			whenever you need it.
*
*	- A function consists of the word function follwed by the function name. There are always parentheses after
*	  the function name, followed by an opening brace. The statement that make up the function go on the following
*     lines, and then the function is closed by another brace. Here's what a function looks like:
*
*		function saySomething() {
*			alert("Four score and seven years ago");
*		}
*
*		Notice that the alert is indented. That makes it easier to read your code. All of the satements between the first
*		brace and the last one are part of the function.
*
*	- Member Function: a function that is a property of an object
*		You are de-binding its this value, ie the context in which it runs
*		http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/terse-javascript-101-part-2/
*
*
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	USING EXTERNAL SCRIPTS
*
*	- You'll often want multiple HTML pages to share the same script.
*	- Include a reference to an external script, a separate file that just contains JavaScript.
*	- The external file is called a .js file 
*	- Individual pages call the .js file simply adding a new attribute, src, to the script tag.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	PUTTING COMMENTS IN SCRIPTS
*
*	- Multi-line comments, /* lorem ipsum dolor lorem ipsum dolor */
*	- Single-line comments, //lorem ipsum
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	ALERTING THE USER
*	
*	- To alert a user:
*			alert("Welcome to my JavaScript page!");
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	CONFIRMING A USER'S CHOICE
*
*	- Conditionals break down into three parts:
*			1 - the 'if' section, where we do our test.
*			2 - the 'then' section, where we put the part of the script we want to do if the result is true.
*			3 - an optional 'else' section, contains the part of the script we want to have happen if the result of the test is not true.
*
*			The contents of what we're testing in the if section are in parantheses, and the contents of the other two sections
*			are each contained in braces.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	WHAT IS 'this'?
*	
*	- The JavaScript keyword 'this' allows the script to pass a value to a function, soley based on the context where the 
*	  keyword is used.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	DOM SCRIPTING
*	
*	- An approach to scripting web pages using JavaScript, in which the code only modifies pages via manipulation of the W3C DOM
*	- document.getElementById("redirect").onclick is an example of DOM scripting in action
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	UNOBTRUSIVE SCRIPTING
*	
*	- Where the code is separated out from the HTML, so that both are more flexible.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	LOOPS
*	
*	- Example: 
*		Doing a search and replace in a word processor. You search for one bit of text, change it to a different 
*		text string, repeat the processes for all of the instances of the first string in the document. Now imagine
*		that you have a program that does it for you automatically. The program would execute a loop, which lets it
*		repeat an action a specified number of times.
*
*	- For Loop: uses a counter, which is a variable that begins with one value (usually 0) and ends when a conditional
*				test inside the loop is satisfied.
*				
*				The command that starts the loop structure is immediately followed by parantheses. Inside the parantheses
*				you'll usually find the counter definition and the way the counter is incremented.
*
*				A for loop has three parts:
*
*					i=0; i<userNum; i++
*
*					1 - Initialization, i=0
*						the first time through the loop
*
*					2 - The limiting step, i<userNum
*						where we say when to stop looping
*
*					3 - The increment step, i++
*						where we say by how much to increase the loop counter on each pass through the loop
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	PASSING
*	
*	- Take some information and give it to a function to use.
*			
*			function playBall(batterup)
*			
*			- Variable batterup is a 'parameter' of the function
*			- When you are inside the function, the data is in the batterup variable
*			- Functions can be passed data i.e. text strings, numbers, other JavaScript objects
*
*			EX: batterup variable could be passed a player's name as a text string ("Mantle") or his number in the lineup (7)
*
*			- You can use more than one parameter in a function, just separate them inside the parantheses with commas.
*			
*			function currentScore(hometeam,visitors)
*
*			- 	Underscore the parameters and variables, so they can be passed a variety of different values 
*				when the function is called. So these code fragments are all equivalent:
*				
*				currentScore(6,4);
*
*				var homeScore = 6;
*				var visitingScore = 4;
*				currentScore(homescore, visitingScore);
*
*				currentScore(6,3+1);
*
*				For all 3 examples, once we're inside the currentScore(), the value of the hometeam is 6 and the value of visitors is 4.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	DETECTING OBJECTS
*	
*	- You may want to check to see if the browser is smart enough to understand the objects you want to use. 
*	- This is called 'object detection'.
*
*	- Pose a question for the object you're looking for:
*
*		if (document.getElementById) {
*
*			If the object exists, the if statement is true and the script continues
*			If the browser doesn't understand the object, the test returns false, and the else portion of the conditional executes.
*
*	- An alternate way to try and figure which objects a browser supports is to do a 'browser detect'
*	  which tries to identify the browser being used to view the page. It gets this be requesting the 
*	  user agent string from the browser, which reports the browser name and version.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	WORKING WITH ARRAYS
*	
*	- Array: kind of variable that can store a group of information.
*	- It can contain data such as: text strings, sumbers, other JavaScript objects
*	- Declare an array with the elements of the array inside parantheses, separated by commas:
*		
*		var newCars = new Array("Toyota", "Honda", "Nissan");
*
*		To access the contents of the array, you use the variable name with the index number of the array member you want to use in square brackets.
*		newCars[2] has the value of "Nissan"
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	A BIT ABOUT BITS
*	
*	- Bitwise Arithmetic: use 'and' and 'or' on numbers greater than 1
*		
*			and (&)	
*			when we 'and' two bits together, if they're both true (that is, both 1), the result is true. Otherwise, the result is false.
*
*			or (|)
*			when we 'or' two bits together, if either is true (that is, either is 1), then the result is true. If they're both false, the 
*			result is false.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	GETTING WISE ABOUT BITS
*
*	- Bitwise Arithmetic: take advantage of the way computers internally keep track of everything as 1s and 0s
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	HTML: IMAGES
*	
*	*Tag*		*Attribute*			*Meaning*
*	 img							 	contains the attributes that describe the image to be displayed by the browser
*					src				 	contains the URL of the image, relative to the URL of the web page	
*					width				contains the width (in pixels) at which the browser will display the image
*					height				contains the height (in picels) at which the browser will display the image
*					border				the width of the border to be displayed
*					name				name that JavaScript uses to refer to this image; as w/ other JavaScript objects,
*										no spaces or other punctuation is allowed, and it cannot start with a number
*					alt					used for noni-visual browsers in place of the image
*					hspace				a horizontal buffer area around the image
*					vspace				a vertical buffer area around the image
*					align				describes where this image should be placed on the page in terms of horizontal or vertical
*										alignment
*					id					a unique identifier, which JavaScript will use to manipulate the image
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	HTML: FRAMES
*	
*	*Tag*		*Attribute*			*Meaning*
*	 frametag							specifies that the page consists of two or more framed pages; contains the 
*										frame tags that specify the particular pages.
*					cols				the column dimensions (proportional/fixed), in pixels, of each frame.
*	 frame								the location and attributes of each framed page.
*					id					used by JavaScript to refer to one of the pages in the frameset.
*					name				an alternate method by which JavaScript can refer to one of the pages in the frameset.
*					src					the physical location (ie URL) of the page loaded into the frame.
*	 iframe								an internal frame, displayed inside the calling HTML page.
*					id					JavaScript uses this to refer to the iframe.
*					name				Javascript can alternately use this to refer to the iframe.
*					src					the URL of the iframe page.
*					width				the width (in pixels or percent) of the iframe.
*					height				the height (in pixels or percent) of the iframe.
*					align				aligns the iframe right or left.
*					frameborder			displays a border around the iframe.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	JAVASCRIPT STRINGS
*
*	Q: When does a word like 'cat' have a 't' in the second position?
*	A: When it's a JavaScript string.
*
*	In JavaScript the first character is at position 0.
*		C is position 0
*		A is position 1
*		T is position 2
*
*	Only when checking the length of cat do we actually see a value of 3. 
*	All other string methods are zero-based; that is, they start with 0.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	ADDING PARAMETERS TO WINDOWS
*	
*	To add one or more parameters to your windows, state them in the open() command enclosed in quotes, 
*	with =yes after the name of a feature you want and =no fter one you don't want.
*
*	EX: if you want a window of a specified size with a toolbar, location box, and scrollbars
*			toolbar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,width=300,height=300
*		
*		as part of the open command. Note that the window created would not have a menu bar or a status bar, and would not be resizable.
*
*	Given that leaving a parameter off entirely is the same as setting it to =no, 
*	you can also just use the name of the parameter itself (without the =yes) to turn it on.
*	
*	B/c there are some exceptions, we've preferred to make it a little more obvious in these scripts as 
*	to what we're turning on and off-consequesntly, we've combined them, followed by a yes or no
*		(i.e. location,scrollbars=yes means the same thing as location-yes,scrollbars=yes)
*
*	We could also just say, location,scrollbars but it wouldn't be as clear what was going on.

*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	ACCOMODATING THE JAVASCRIPT-IMPAIRED USER
*
*	The point of Ch.7: Select-and-Go Navigation is to use JavaScript to eliminate the need for a Go button when using 
*	a form to jump from one page to another. 
*
*	http://www.marklreyes.com/tutorials/2_vqg_jsAJAX/html/ch7/script01.html
*
*	But what if the user has JavaScript turned off?
*	Put a GO button that's only visible in the absence of JavaScript.
*	The only way to get from one page to another with a form but w/o JavaScript is to use a CGI, a program running on the Web server.
*
*	<form action="gotoLocation.cgi">
*
*	The form tag has the action attribute, which calls the CGI. But a form action requires the user to click a submit button 
*	which isn't shown in script01.html. Only when JavaScript is turned off, is when the button will show. These lines contain 
*	the button, wrapped in noscript tags, which are only exectuted if JavaScript is missing.
*
*		<noscript>
*			<input type="submit" value="Go There!" />
*		</noscript>
*
*	A CGI only ever gets called if JavaScript is missing.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
* 	RADIO BUTTONS: are an either/or interface element that let the user pick one choice within a group of options.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	REGULAR EXPRESSIONS aka 'RegExp' aka 'grep'
*	
*	Are a powerful way to validate and format strings. Using regular expressions, you can write a line or two of JavaScript code that can 
*	accomplish tasks that otherwise would have taken several dozen lines.
*
*	RegExp is a pattern written using special symbols, which describes one or ore text strings. You use RegExp to match patterns
*   of text, so that your script can easily recognize and manipulate text. Like an arithmetic expression, you create a RegExp by using
*	operators, in this case operators that work on text rather than numbers.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	REGULAR EXPRESSION SPECIAL CHARACTERS
*
*	*Characters*				*Matches*
*		\							Toggles between literal and special characters; for example, "\w" means the special value of 
*									"\w" instead of the the literal "w" but "\$" means to ignore the special value of "$" and use 
*									the "$" character instead
*		^							Beginning of a string
*		$							End of a string
*		*							Zero or more times
*		+							One or more times
*		?							Zero or one time
*		.							Any character except newline
*		\b							Word boundary
*		\B							Non-word boundary
*		\d							Any digit 0 through 9 (same as [0-9])
*		\D							Any non-digit
*		\f							Form feed
*		\n							New line
*		\r							Carriage return
*		\s							Any single white space character {same as [ \f\n\r\t\v])
*		\S							Any single non-white space character
*		\t							Tab
*		\v							Vertical tab
*		\w							Any letter, number, or the underscore (same as[a-zA-Z0-9_])
*		\W							Any character other than a letter, nu,ber, or underscore
*		\xnn						The ASCII character defined by the hexadecimal number nn
*		\onn						The ASCII character defined by the octal number nn
*		\cX							The control character X
*		[abcde]						A character set that matches any one in the range of enclosed characters
*		[^abcde]					A complemented or negated character set; one that does not match any of the enclosed characters
*		[a-e]						A character set that matches any one in the range of enclosed characters
*		[\b]						The literal backspace character (different from \b)	
*		{n}							Exactly n occurences of the previous character
*		{n,}						At least n occurences of the previous character
*		{n,m}						Between n and m occurences of the previous character
*		()							a grouping, which is also stored for later use	
*		x|y							Either x or y

*********************************************************************************************************************
*	ABOUT THE REGEXP OBJECT
*
*	JavaScript has a built-in Regexp object that's automatically set (and reset) everytime a script executes
*	a regular expression method (given in METHODS OF THE REGEXP OBJECT and STRING METHODS tables).
*
*	The RegExp object isnt a variable that contains the result of the regular expression operation, but rather it contains
*	the 'pattern' described by the regular expression, in a form that can be used in your scripts via the RegExp object's properties
*	and methods.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	EVENTS
*
*	Events are actions that the user performs while visiting your page. When the browser detects an event, such as a 
*	mouse click or a key press, it can trigger JavaScript objects associated with that event, called 'event handlers'.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	HANDLING WINDOW EVENTS
*
*	Window events occur when the user does something affecting an entire brwoser window. The most common window event is simply loading
*	the window by opening a particular web page. You can also have events that trigger event handlers when windows are closed, moved,
*	or event sent to the background.
*
*	When working with event handlers, you'll often find it useful to connect an evet handler to an object using dot syntax, like so:
*			window.focus
*			window.onload
*			document.mousedown
*
*	Note, when you use the event handler as part of an object like this, the event handler is written all in lowercase. Also, keep your
*	event handlers in external scripts, rather than placing them inside the HTML tag-this approach is more standards compliant, it 
*	separates out the JavaScript code from the HTML code, and it's easier to edit (or replace), all your JavaScript code in an external file.
*
*	- THE ONLOAD EVENT
*		It is triggered when the user enters your page and all its elements have completed loading.
*	
*	- THE ONUNLOAD EVENT
*		The onunload handler is triggered when the user leaves your web page. The most common use for this is advertising windows that pop up
*		when you leave some commercial sites, especially pornographic sites. If you find yourself on one of the latter, you'll often find that 
*		that it's almost impossible to leave-every time you close a window or attempt ot navigate away from the site, window after window 
*		appears,re-opening the same or other pages, all of the same genre.
*
*		Consequently, people have come to hate the onunload handler w/ a passion, so use it sparingly.
*
*	- THE ONRESIZE EVENT
*		If a user came in and either the height or the width of the window has changed, the user resized the window, and we want to force the 
*		page to reload. If the browser window size hasn't changed, the onresize handler is triggered drawing scrollbars and it 
*		can't be ignored.
*	
*	- THE ONMOVE EVENT
*		The onmove event handler is triggered when the window is moved.
*
*	- THE ONABORT EVENT
*		The onabort event handler is triggered when the user cancels an image loading on the web page. It's not used very often, and not all 
*		browsers seem to fully support it.
*
*	- THE ONERROR EVENT
*		The onerror event may be triggered when a JavaScript error occurs on the page.
*
*		TIP:
*			- It can be polite to set onerror = null; in complex pages you put on the web. With this line of code on your page, 
*		  	  some error messages will not be displayed to the user in the unfortunate event that there's a problem-but which errors 
*		  	  will be hidden depends on the browser.
*
*	- THE ONFOCUS EVENT
*		The onfocus handler triggers when a page becomes the front-most active window. It catches the onfocus handler and forces the page to
*		always go to the back.
*
*	- THE ONBLUR EVENT
*		If you have a window that you always want to remain in front of all your other windows (ie a control panel that loads content on the
*		main page), it forces its way back up to the front again.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	MOUSE EVENT HANDLING
*		Many of the user's interactions with your pages come in the form of mouse movements or mouse clicks. JavaScript provides a robust 
*		set of handlers for these events.
*
*	- THE ONMOUSEDOWN EVENT
*
*	- THE ONMOUSEUP EVENT
*		Similar to the onmousedown event, the onmouseup event is triggered when the user clicks the mouse and then releases the button.
*
*	- THE ONMOUSEMOVE EVENT
*		The onmousemove event is triggered whenever a visitor to your page moves their mouse.
*
*	- THE ONMOUSEOVER EVENT
*		You should be familiar with this event from image rollovers. This event will be triggered whenever the mouse is moved into any area 
*		for which the onmouseover has been registered.
*
*	- THE ONMOUSEOUT EVENT
*		Where there's an onmouseover, there's usually an onmouseout event. This is triggered when the user moves the mouse out of an area for 
*		which the event has been registered.
*
*	- THE ONDBLCLICK EVENT
*		There's no double-clicking on the web, yet users learn to double-click with the mouse. This handler will be able to check for that.
*
*	- THE ONCLICK EVENT
*		The onclick handler works in a similar fashion to the ondblclick handler, except that a single click triggers instead of a double
*		click. The onmouseup handler is also similar, except that the onclick requires that the user press the mouse button both down and
*		up in order to be triggered, while the onmouseup requires just the latter.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	FORM EVENT HANDLING
*
*		You'll want to use form event handling mainly for validating forms. With the events listed below, you can deal with just about any
*		action the user takes with forms.
*
*	- THE ONSUBMIT EVENT
*		The onsubmit handler is triggered when the user clicks the submit button to complete a form. In addition, depending on the browser,
*		it can also be triggered when a user exists the last text entry field on a form. If a script contains an onsubmit handler, and the
*		result of the handler is false, the form will not be sent back to the server.
*
*	- THE ONRESET EVENT
*		The onreset handler is triggered when the user clicks the reset button (if one is present) on a form. This can be handy if your form
*		has default values that are set when the page loads-if the user clicks reset, you'll need to handle this situation with a script 
*		that resets the default values dynamically.
*
*	- THE ONCHANGE EVENT
*		The onchange event handler is triggered when the user changes a form field. This cab used to verify they entered information
*		immediately, or to respond to the user's choice before they click the submit button.
*
*	- THE ONSELECT EVENT
*		The onselect handler is triggered if the user selects text in either an input or a textarea form field.
*
*	- THE ONCLICK EVENT
*		It's most commonly used when dealing with forms.This event is triggered when the user click a check box or radio button also uses
*		the onclick handler. In that case, it allows a single link to do one action for JavaScript enabled browsers and another, entirely
*		different action, for browsers without JavaScript.
*
*	- THE ONBLUR EVENT
*		While the onblur handler can be used for browser windows, it's more common for it to be used in forms.
*
*	- THE ONFCOUS EVENT
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	KEY EVENT HANDLING
*
*	Besides the mouse, the other main input device is the keyboard. Just as with the mouse, JavaScript has the mojo to handle the keyboard.
*
*	- THE ONKEYDOWN EVENT
*
*	- THE ONKEYUP EVENT
*		The onkeyup event handler is identical to the onkeydown handler, except that it gets called when the user has completed pressing the 
*		key down and is now letting it come back up again.
*
*	- THE ONKEYPRESS EVENT
*		the onkeypress event is triggered when the user both presses a key down and also lets the key back up again-just 
*		for completeness's sake.
*
*		TIP:
*			- If you're not sure what the key values are for a particular key, you can find out by putting the line alert(thiskey); in
*			  between the lines of code in steps 5 and 6, then, press the key for which you want to fund the value. The aler box contains 
*			  the numerica key value. (SEE SCRIPT10.JS VIA CHAPTER 9)

*********************************************************************************************************************
*	JAVASCRIPT AND COOKIES
*
*	- Cookie: a unique nugget of information that a web server gives to your browser when the two first meet and which they then share 
*			  with each return visit. The remote server saves its part of the cookie and the information it contains about you; your 
*			  browser does the same, as a plain text file stored on your computer's hard disk.
*
*	- If your site requires registration, you can set cookies to store your readers' user names and passwords on their hard drives, so they
*	  they don't need to enter them every time they visit.
*	
*	- You can keep track of which parts of your site the user has visited and count the number of visits from that user.
*
*	- You can't get any real infomration about the user such as their email address; you can't use cookies to check out the contents of their
*	  hard disks; and cookies can't transmit computer viruses.
*
*	- A cookies is just a simple text file on the user's hard disk where you, the JavaScript programmer, can store some information.
*
*	- A cookie always includes the address of the server that sent it. The primary idea behind cookie technology: identification. Think of
*	  it is Caller ID for the web.
*
*	- When you return to the web server that first passed you a particular cookie, the server can query your browser to see if you are one of 
*	  its many cookie holders. If so, the server can then retrieve the information stored in the cookie the two of you originally exchanged.
*	  Keep in mind that cookies just identify the computer being used, not the individual using the computer.
*
*	- A cookie is a text string with a particular format:
*		cookieName=cookieValue;	
*		expires=expirationDateGMT; path=URLpath;
*		domain=siteDomain
*
*		The first part of the string gives the cookie a name and assigns it a value. This is the only mandatory part of a cookie. The rest of
*		the string is optional. 
*
*		Next is the expiration date of the cookie; when this date is reached, the browser automatically deletes the cookie. The expiration
*		date is followed by a URL path, which lets you store a URL cookie.
*
*		Finally, you can store a domain value in the cookie.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	A FISTFUL OF COOKIES
*
*	- You can have multiple cookies on a page, and the format for this is:
*			cookieName1=cookieValue1; expires1=expirationDateGMT1; path1=sitePath1; domain1=siteDomain1;
*			cookieName2=cookieValue2; expires2=expirationDateGMT2; path2=sitePath2; domain2=siteDomain2;
*
*	- The only mandatory fields are the name and value pair.
*
*	- The split("; ") command splits the multiple cookie record into an array, with each cookie in a cookie record numbered from 0 on.
*
*	- Note that this is the space after the semicolon in this command. So cookieArray[0] would be the first cookie in the multiple cookie
*	  record, cookieArray[1] would be next, and so on. For more, see Ch:10 Handling Multiple Cookies.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	READING A COOKIE
*
*	- Once you've set a cookie, you'll need to retrieve it in order to do anything useful.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	USING COOKIES AS COUNTERS
*
*	- Because a cookie is specific to a user, you can only tell that user how many times he or she has visited you
*	- You can't use cookies to tell all users how many times the page has been hit.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	DELETING COOKIES
*
*	- One technique that works well is to simply set the cookie's expiration date to a date in the past, which causes the browser
*	  to delete it automatically.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	DISPLAYING "NEW TO YOU" MESSAGES
*
*	- You can use cookies and JavaScript to alert frequent visitors to your site to items that are new to them.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	MORE ABOUT substring()
*
*	- The command substring(to, from) returns the characters in a string, starting with the to position and ending with the character
*	  just before the from position, zero-relative. If the string contains "20060807" and you want characters 5 and 6, you want to use
*	  substring(4,6). Your result is the string "08"
*
*	- The from parameter is optional; leaving it off means you'll get the string starting from the to position all the way to the end.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	OBJECTS AND THE DOM
*
*   Node manipulation is the W3C-recommended way for standards-compliant browsers to support web pages that act more like applications 
*	than the standard static pages. 
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	ABOUT NODE MANIPULATION
*
*	- DOM-2 AND THE W3C
*		The W3C has released specifications for how browsers should handle the Doucment Object Model.
*		
*		The DOM Level 2 specification goes into more depth as to how browsers should be able to refer to and manage the content of
*		their pages. See, http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/
*
*	- DOM-2 TERMINOLOGY
*		A different way to look at HTML pages, as a tree structure with 'nodes'.
*		
*		<html>
*		<head>
*			<title>My page</title>
*		</head>
*		<body>
*			<p>This is text on my page</p>
*		</body>
*		</html>
*	
*		We can use JavaScript to modify any aspect of this tree, including add, access, change and delete nodes on the tree.
*		Each box on the tree is a node.
*		If the node contains an HTML tag, it's referred to as an 'element node'.
*		Otherwise, it's referred to as a 'text node'.
*		Element nodes can contain text nodes.
*
*	- DOM-3
*		Level 3 specification is at http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/
*		Learn more about DOM-3, look at ECMAScript bindings, http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/ecma-script-binding.html
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	ABOUT OBJECT LITERALS
*
*	- Standard procedural JavaScript, like what you've seen so far, has been in the dot notation format:
*
*		var myCat = new Object;
*		mycat.name = "Pixel";
*		myCat.breed = "Tuxedo";
*		myCat.website = "www.pixel.mu";
*
*		function allAboutMyCat {
*			alert('Can I tell you about my cat?');
*			tellMeMore = true;
*		}
*
*	- Where in object literal format, that same code would be something like this:
*
*		var myCat = {
*			name : "Pixel",
*			breed: "Tuxedo",
*			website: "www.pixel.mu",
*			allAbout: function() {
*				alert("Can I tell you about my cat?");
*				tellMeMore = true;
*			}
*		}
*
*	- With either format, you can refer to a propery of myCat as myCat.name (for instance). However, with object literal format,
*	  the function becomes myCat.allAbout() instead of allAboutMyCat().
*
*	- If at this point you're thinking that this looks sort of familiar, pat yourself on the back-it's very similar, in many ways
*	  to CSS. At it's most basic level, it's a list of property and value pairs, with the colon in between and a seperator around
*     each pair.
*
*	- Some differences to remember when using object literals:
*		* Properties are set using : not =.
*		* Lines end with , instead of ;.
*		* No comma is needed on the last statement inside the object.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	WHY OBJECT LITERALS?
*
* 	- There are several reasons why a programmer might want to use the object literal versus procedural approach to JavaScript:
*
*		* Because each object (including methods and properties) is contained within one parent object, you never run into a
*		  problem with overwriting other people's code. If you and you co-worker both have a variable called myText in your 
*		  respective .js files, and some page brings in both files, then whichever page load takes precedence - one is going 
*		  to write directly over the other, and it will be as if that code never loaded. The solution: make sure you don't use
*		  global variables , and the simplest way to do that is to tuck all of yours away neatly inside an object literal.
*
*		* A subset of the object literal has been dubbed JavaScript Object Notation, better known as JSON. JSON is one of the most
*		  common data formats for Ajax, and as such, you're likely to see a lot of it when you start working with Ajax.
*		
*		* Like everything else, programming languages have styles that go in and out of fashion. JavaScript itself is on its second
*		  upswing, and as part of the renewed interest in scripting, the current trend is towards increased use of object literals,
*		  so it helps to get used to seeing them.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	JAVASCRIPT'S INCONSISTENT HANDLING OF TIME
*		
*	JavaScript begins numbering at zero in most cases, so numbering begins with 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. But this isn't consistent with 
*	dates, which begin with the number 1. So if you have an array that deals with the days of the week, you'll have this:
*
*	Sunday = 0
*	Monday = 1
*	Tuesday = 2
*	Wednesday = 3
*	Thursday = 4
*	Friday = 5
*	Saturday = 6
*
*	In much the same way, the 12 months of the year are number from 0 to 11.
*
*	On the other hand, when you're dealing with the date of the month, it makes no sense to start at zero, so JavaScript starts at 1.
*
*	Hours are dealt with from 0 (midnight) to 23 (11PM), using a 24-hour clock. later in Ch. 12, we'll show how to convert from a 
*	24-hour clock to a 12-hour clock.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	MORE WEIRD TIME STUFF (p. 307)
*	
*	Month numbering in JavaScript begins with 0 and day numbering with 1, and JavaScript deals inconsistently with years prior to 1970,
*	depending on the version of JavaScript your browser is using.
*
*	Recommend that you use getFullYear() anytime you know that you'll be working with version 4 and later browsers.

*	AJAX: PINNING IT DOWN
*
*	- Using XHTML and CSS for structure and presentation.
*	- Display and manipulating pages using the Document Object Model.
*	- Using the browser's XMLHttpRequest object to transfer data between the client and the server.
*	- Using XL as the format for the data flowing between the client and server.
*	- And finally, using JavaScript to dynamically display and interact with all of the above.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************

*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	GETTING YOUR DATA
*
*	A script can only read a file that comes from the same server as the one that the script is on itself. If a script could read anything, then tat would open up all kinds of 
*	possible security scams and fake sites.
*
*	You can have a program on your server that goes out periodically, grabs an XML file, and then stores it locally. Once you've done that, your Ajax application will have no
*	problems reading it. 
*
*	In the Flickr example, it is assumed taht you've got something running that grabs the Flickr data file of your choice periodically and saves it on your server.
*
*	You can (in some cases) use a script that's hosted by the destination server itself-which can then read its own files, and report the results back to you.
*
*********************************************************************************************************************
*	CONTAINER TYPES
*
*	Module: can appear anywhere on your page, and the user treats it as a single unit (if you allow it to be manipulated)
*	Overlay: extension of module that floats above the document's inline content and doesn't affect the flow of text & images on the page.
*	Tooltip: creates small floating boxes similar to the ones that provide contextual help in operating systems like Windows and MAC OS X.
*	Panel: mimics an operating system window.
*	Dialog: creates a standard dialog that can look like a system dialog.
*	Simple Dialog: behaves like an operating system alert, with dual choices (yes/no, ok/cancel, etc).
