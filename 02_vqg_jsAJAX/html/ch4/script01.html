	<title>A Simple Rollover</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
	<a href="next.html" onmouseover="document.arrow.src='images/arrow_on.gif'" onmouseout="document.arrow.src='images/arrow_off.gif'"><img src="images/arrow_off.gif" width="147" height="82" border="0" name="arrow" alt="arrow" /></a>

<!--
Rollovers: you have two images
	1 - original image: loaded and displayed along with the rest of the web page by the user
	2 -	replacement image: when mouse is moved over the first image, browser swaps out the 
		first image for the second, giving the illusion of movement or animation

	onmouseover="document.arrow.src='images/arrow_on.gif'"
		when the user moves the mouse over the image, the replacement image, arrow_on.gif is written to the document window
	
	onmouseout="document.arrow.src='images/arrow_off.gif'"
		when the mouse moves away, arrow_off.gif is swapped back in

	alt attribute included are required if you want HTML to be compliant with 
	W3C standards, plus helps make your page accessible to disabled users 
	(i.e. visually impaired users who use screen readers)

Disadvantages to this kind of rollover
	1 - the second image is donwloaded fromt he server at the time the user rolls over the first image, there can be perceived delay
		before the second image replaces the first once, especially for people browsing your site with a slower connection
	2 - using this method causes an error message in ancient browsers
