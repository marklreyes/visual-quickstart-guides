<!-- 
event handling in jQuery begins by connecting an event, such as a mouseclick, to an event handler.
		event occurs > event handler is called > code in the event handler is executed

bind a page element's event to an event handler using the bind() function.
example, if a page contains an image and you want to bind one of the image's events to an event handler use,
		$("img").bind(event, data, handler)
		
		event, is a string holding the type of event
		possible values: blur, focus, load, resize, scroll, unload, beforeunload, click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseup, mousemove, mouseover, mouseout, mouseenter, mouseleave, change, select, submit, keydown, keypress, keyup, error
		
		data, parameter holds optional data you want passed to the event handler as the data property of the event object (you can delete this parameter)
		
		handler, is the event handler function
		
this example shows how to bind the click event of an image to an event handler that displays an alert box
