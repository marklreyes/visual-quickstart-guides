<!-- 
you can setup a single event handler to handle a type of event for many different elements

EX: you may have many images in a page and want to write a click event handler for them all, saving you the need to duplicate a lot of code.
		you'll need to determine from the event object the page element in which the event occured.
		do that with the target property of the event object.
		
target property contains an object corresponding to the page element that was the target of the event.
	ex: if an image was clicked, the event object passsed to its click event handler will contain an object corresponding to the image.
	
EX: use the vent object's target property to recover and display the ID value of an image that the user clicked.
